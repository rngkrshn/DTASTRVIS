# DTASTRVIS

This repository contains a small Tkinter application that visualizes a few data structure and algorithm concepts. Currently it shows:

- **Bubble sort** on a list of random numbers. Use the **Bubble Sort** button to animate the algorithm and **Stop** to halt it.
- **Stack** operations (push and pop).

## Running the app

```bash
python3 app.py
```

A window will open with tabs for Sorting and Stack. Use the buttons provided to interact and watch the structures update.
